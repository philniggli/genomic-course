# Exercise 1b (3)

## Task
Create an HTML document that samples 100 values from a log-normal distribution (say, mu=1, sigma=.25); create a histogram of the distribution and the distribution on the log scale; report the mean and variance of the sample in line in the text. In general, do not just dump the R code and plots in the HTML document; break your exercises into sections with headings, add some text and make it readable.

## Code
```{r}
set.seed(10)
data <- rlnorm(100, 1, 0.25)
hist(data, main = "Histogram of the simulated data" )
hist(log(data), main = "Histogram of the simulated data on the log scale")

mean.data <- mean(data)
var.data <- var(data)
```


## Results
The mean of the simulated data is `r mean.data`, the variance is `r var.data`. The simulation was generated with set.seed(10).
